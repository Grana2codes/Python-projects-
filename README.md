# Python-projects-
These projects are usually to do with networking, data analysis, web scraping and automation

I have been learning Python for about a year and would say I am at an intermediate level. I work in networking so my role is programmer-adjacent. 
There are not a lot of resources for python that have to do with networking so I've had to piece a lot of it together by reading manuals and such. 
Even something as simple as a basic SSH python script to connect to a remote device and pass a command is hard to find.

I have another repo that is private that I've used to keep reference to some of the programs I've made. Now that I feel that I know enough to share with others I will 
mantain a public repo 

Hopefully this will be of some use to someone else who is interested in learning Python, software-defined networking and devops.
